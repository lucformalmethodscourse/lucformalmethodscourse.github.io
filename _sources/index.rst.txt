Welcome! Willkomme! ¡Bienvenidos/as! Benvenuti/e!

In this course, we study formal methods suitable for contemporary software engineering practice. 
This version of the course is normally taught by `Konstantin Läufer <https://github.com/klaeufer>`_ and focuses on functional and concurrent programming languages with examples and projects mostly in TBD.
